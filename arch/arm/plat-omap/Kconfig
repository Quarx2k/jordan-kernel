	  Say Y if you want to enable SmartReflex.

	  SmartReflex can perform continuous dynamic voltage
	  scaling around the nominal operating point voltage
	  according to silicon characteristics and operating
	  conditions. Enabling SmartReflex reduces power
	  consumption.

	  Please note, that by default SmartReflex is only
	  initialized. To enable the automatic voltage
	  compensation for VDD1 and VDD2, user must write 1 to
	  /sys/power/sr_vddX_autocomp, where X is 1 or 2.

	  Say Y if you want to reset unused clocks during boot.
	  This option saves power, but assumes all drivers are
	  using the clock framework. Broken drivers that do not
	  yet use clock framework may not work with this option.
	  If you are booting from another operating system, you
	  probably do not want this option enabled until your
	  device drivers work properly.

	  Select this option if you want to enable the OMAP 32KHz timer.
	  This timer saves power compared to the OMAP_MPU_TIMER, and has
	  support for no tick during idle. The 32KHz timer provides less
	  intra-tick resolution than OMAP_MPU_TIMER. The 32KHz timer is
